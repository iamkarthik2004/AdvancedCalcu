### Project Description
This project is a multifunctional calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric calculations, square roots, permutations, and combinations. It's designed to be user-friendly and accessible for students and casual users alike.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Students struggle with complex calculations and wish for a calculator that can do everything without needing to switch apps or devices. Who needs to calculate when they can just ask their friends?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a calculator that not only performs basic math but also adds a bit of flair with functions like sine, cosine, tangent, and even square roots, all wrapped in a colorful interface that could distract you from your homework!
